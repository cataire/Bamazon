# Bamazon

A command line shopping application that uses Node.js and MySQL and allows users buy products.

## Customer View Level

On the Customer level the app allows user to see the inventory, enter the item and the amount that they want to buy, see the order summary and place their order. If there is not sufficient amount of products the user will be prompted to change the amount or select another item.



On the backend the app makes the request to MySQL database and updates the amount when the user makes the purchase.
